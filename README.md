## Process:
1. accessed the files by looking into a few websites that provided the data (see references). 
2. Uploaded the CSV files into Excel and started to look deeper into the different values.
3. Into Tableau and filtered the different countries into 5 random.
4. Created visualisations for location (Geo) and ug/m3 emissions. Created a persuasive infographic using data I have found related to the environment.
